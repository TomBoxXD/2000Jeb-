Once Jeb’s hand was off the Bible, the gradual collapse of the American system would soon be underway.</p><p>First was the judicial system, with Jeb and his fellow conservatives working on undermining it through talk of ‘judicial reform’. This was the first step towards authoritirianism the United States would go towards, but it was not the last. Democrats and concerned Republicans that spoke out against these moves were quickly punished by the Department of Homeland Security for ‘un-American behavior’.</p>", "<p>Then the ‘02 midterms saw a big win for the Democrats, that campaigned constantly against Jeb’s actions in destroying American democracy. While words and actions were good, increasingly the political system was seeing less of the Congress having power and more being a rubber-stamp for the president.

They would make nudges for him to run, but Jeb would give no comment. Whenever he was asked by a reporter if he would run, he would give vague answers. It definitely was something he toyed with but not planning on. It would all come to a head in ‘99 when at a ceremony for the preservation of the Everglades a reporter asked Jeb if he would announce his run for president. Jeb would give his comment:</p><p>“I am currently not considering it, now please no more questions at this moment thank you.”</p>", "<p>The absence of Jeb left the primaries to be anyone’s game, but one person out of the pack would make an effort to do so.

Domestically he would work to get legislation for campaign finance reform alongside other conservative measures. While he would claim to be a maverick throughout his entire term, he was anything but. It would seem President McCain took the establishment Republican position on the current issues, and the idea of the maverick would slowly start to dissipate.</p><p>Although after 9/11 happened and the Twin Towers were struck, for a brief time there was unity among the country. McCain’s approval rating soared to as high as 90% at one point, and he would lead the country to war. The war in Afghanistan went off without a hitch, but Iraq was different. The claims of weapons of mass destruction from Saddam Hussein led to the toppling of him, and the process of ‘building democracy’ in Iraq.</p>", "<p>Now it is 2004 and the McCain presidency is stable, if a bit rocky. McCain’s image as a war-time president has helped him immensely, and some claim that if he weren’t he wouldn’t stand a chance against however the Democrats nominate. Speaking of Democrats, the lineup for the primaries seems clear. Senator Kerry, Governor Dean, Representative Kucinich, and a lot of other names are thrown around as contenders. Whoever the person may be, they will need to do a good job at trying to take the White House.</p><p>And there remains Jeb Bush. The governor that was once the darling of people like Limbaugh is disgusted by him now. Now working in the private sector and making occasional appearances with Governor Crist at select events, maybe the time for politics is over for him. Sure he got the governor’s office, but that must not be all he wants right? What if he wanted to dip his toes back into politics again? Maybe a run for Senate in ‘04?
